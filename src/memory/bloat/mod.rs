//! Anti-bloat (P4). The plan's premise: disk/token bloat is a non-problem (thousands of
//! entries are still µs to scan); the REAL vectors are (1) frozen-core overflow — handled
//! in P2 by the hard cap + spill + deferred rebuild — and (2) near-duplicate precision-rot
//! in the long tail. This module addresses (2) and keeps the long tail bounded for years:
//!
//! - `dedup`     — MinHash near-dup detection on the write path (char-level guard).
//! - `decay`     — recency down-weighting in the RANK (inferred facts only; never deletes).
//! - `caps`      — per-tier LRU caps → recoverable archive (curated facts exempt).
//! - `supersede` — bi-temporal validity (`active` / `as_of`); facts are superseded, not deleted.

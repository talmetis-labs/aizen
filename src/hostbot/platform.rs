//! The `Platform` contract — the seam that makes "host a bot" independent of *which* chat platform.
//!
//! `aizen serve` (Telegram) and `aizen discord serve` (Discord) each run ONE platform per process, so
//! the daemon is generic over `P: Platform` and monomorphized per platform — no `dyn`, no `async-trait`
//! dep (plain AFIT, stable since Rust 1.75). Adding WhatsApp/Slack/Matrix later = one new file under
//! `platforms/` that `impl Platform`, plus a one-line `pub mod`. The daemon loop never changes.
//!
//! Platform-specific powers (inline approval buttons, multi-bot hosting) are trait methods with a
//! default "unsupported" impl: Telegram overrides them, Discord inherits the defaults, and the shared
//! command dispatcher gates on `supports_*` so `/addbot` is naturally Telegram-only.

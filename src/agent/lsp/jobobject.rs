//! Windows Job Object: guarantees a language server's WHOLE process tree dies with us.
//!
//! Node-based servers (pyright, typescript-language-server) install as `.cmd` shims, so the child
//! we spawn is `cmd.exe`, which then spawns the real `node.exe`. `kill_on_drop`/`TerminateProcess`
//! only kill the direct child — the `node` process would be orphaned and keep running (and holding
//! RAM) after Aizen exits or `/lsp off`. The fix (the standard one, used by every serious Windows
//! process supervisor): put the child in a Job Object configured with
//! `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` — when the job handle closes (our [`Job`] drops, or the
//! Aizen process dies and the OS closes its handles), the kernel terminates every process in the
//! job. Works even on hard crashes, which per-process cleanup code never can.
//!
//! Everything is best-effort: any API failure yields `None` and we fall back to plain
//! `kill_on_drop` (exactly Phase 1 behavior) — never an error, never a crash.
//!
//! This is the only `unsafe` in the codebase; it is confined to four kernel32 calls with
//! locally-checked invariants (valid handle in, struct + size pair match).

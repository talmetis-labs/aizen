//! Turn-scoped execution context — the explicit carrier of per-turn/per-conversation identity that
//! a tool body needs, threaded across the `spawn_blocking` boundary the way [`crate::core::cancel`]
//! already threads the cancellation token.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Tool bodies run on a `spawn_blocking` worker thread (`src/agent/mod.rs`), so any per-turn fact a
//! tool needs must either be captured into the `move` closure or seeded into a thread-local INSIDE
//! that closure — a plain process-global read gives whatever the driver thread last set, which bleeds
//! across turns the moment two turns interleave. Today exactly one turn runs at a time per process
//! (the REPL is serial; the `serve` daemon handles messages serially), so the bleed is latent rather
//! than live — but the browser tools already key their per-conversation session registry off
//! [`crate::core::convo::active()`], so the conversation id is the one piece of context a tool body
//! genuinely reads across the hop. This module makes that read authoritative: the loop pins an
//! `ExecutionContext` for the turn, seeds it into the thread-local inside the same closure that seeds
//! the cancel token, and [`crate::core::convo::active()`] prefers it over the process-global slot.
//!
//! # Migration scaffold (plan P1-A)
//!
//! The context currently carries only the conversation id — the sole cross-hop reader today. Persona
//! override, per-turn reasoning-effort, and the Telegram approval route are also per-turn state, but
//! they are read on the DRIVER thread that sets them (not inside a tool body), so moving them here is
//! defense-in-depth against future turn interleaving rather than a live fix. They migrate onto this
//! struct field-by-field: add the field, seed it at the turn boundary, and switch the corresponding
//! accessor to prefer [`current`] before its process-global — never a big-bang cutover.

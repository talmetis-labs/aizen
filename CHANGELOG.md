# Changelog

All notable changes to **Aizen** (`aizen`, alias `ng`) — the pure-Rust agentic coding CLI.

This repo was extracted from the NextGen monorepo at v0.1.0 (2026-06-27); the detailed pre-0.1.0
development log lives in that monorepo's history.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.8] — 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- **A project's memory, skills and index no longer fork in two depending on whether `git` was on
  PATH** — the zone key was hashed from the git remote URL when git could be found and from the raw
  path when it couldn't, so the same checkout answered to two different zones from one launch to the
  next and half the user's memory went missing without a word. The key is now the normalized
  canonical project path only; the remote URL is informational. `aizen zone migrate` shows what a
  legacy zone holds (dry-run by default) and merges it on `--apply`, including saved conversations,
  which are keyed by provenance inside each file and so were invisible to a per-directory sweep.
- **A missing `git` no longer blocks editing** — `git` not being on PATH was treated as a hard
  checkpoint failure, which refused every edit rather than degrading. It is now benign: checkpoints
  switch off with one warning and work continues. `git` is resolved once through a central resolver
  (`AIZEN_GIT`, then PATH, then the usual install locations) so a GUI-installed git is found even
  when the shell can't see it.
- **`/resume` no longer grafts one project's context onto another** — sessions live in one flat pool,
  so restoring offered whichever conversation was written last, from any project, and replayed its
  stale system lane into the current one. Session files now record their origin (project key/root/
  slug, model, created/updated); the startup hint and bare `/resume` prefer this project's newest
  conversation and label a cross-project offer with `from <dir>`; restoring rebuilds both prompt
  lanes for the current project. `/handoff` rotates to a fresh file instead of overwriting the
  conversation it summarized.
- **The `/sessions` picker says what each row is** — turn count, age, origin project and a `● current`
  marker, newest first, with a confirmation before overwriting another conversation's file and
  `(unreadable)` for a corrupt one instead of a plausible-looking empty row.
- **A failing autosave is no longer silent** — it warns once per failure streak and reports recovery,
  so a conversation that is not reaching disk says so.

### Added
- `aizen where` and `/where` — print the project root, zone slug, resolved `git`, and the paths
  backing memory, skills, the codebase index and sessions, so which zone is in effect is checkable
  rather than inferred.

### Changed
- **Telegram replies are now native, compact HTML instead of raw Markdown** — headings, emphasis,
  inline/fenced code, safe links, lists and quotes use Telegram's supported formatting; Markdown
  tables become narrow stacked records rather than raw pipes or terminal boxes. Rendering is parsed
  with the existing pure-Rust Markdown engine, escapes raw HTML/unsafe links, chunks only at balanced
  block boundaries, and retries once as equivalent plain text if Telegram rejects rich markup.
- **Telegram working status no longer clutters the chat** — a single `✦ Đang xử lý…` message is
  deleted after the final reply is delivered (or edited to a concise success/error state when delete
  or delivery fails). Hostbot turns also receive a mobile-only response contract: lead with the result,
  keep paragraphs/headings short, prefer bullets, and avoid wide diagrams or decorative repetition.
  Discord remains plain text in this scope.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-07-22

### Changed
- **Transcript visuals redesigned around structured events** — tool calls, the plan checklist, edit
  diffs and the verify line are no longer pre-styled strings blindly emitted; they flow through the
  UI as typed events so the retained backend can lay them out by width and update lines/panels in
  place. Every surface renders from the same layout code, so classic/plain/one-shot read identically
  (degrading only where an append-only surface can't update in place).
  - **Tool-call line** opens with `⚙ <tool_name>   <target>` — the raw tool name in moonlight, its
    target dim silver — and drops the result to an indented `└ <digest> · <time>` line **beneath**
    it: the digest tinted by outcome (dim while running, green on ok, salmon on error) and carrying
    the wall-clock run time (`· 940ms` under a second, `· 1.2s` above). Replaces the old
    `◆ <verb> (tool)` footnote shape; the earlier right-aligned-digest variant is gone (the digest
    now always sits below the call, so a long result never collides with the target).
  - **Plan panel** (`todo_write`) is a boxed checklist — header `☑ done/total · plan`, then ✓/▸/○
    rows — that **updates in place** under retained instead of re-printing a fresh `todos:` block on
    every call. Classic re-prints the box; an emptied list removes the panel.
  - **Edit diffs** render inside a rounded `diff · <path>  +A −D` box (added = green `+`, removed =
    salmon `−`) instead of loose indented lines.
  - **Verify gate** success is a green `✓ <cmd> — <detail>` line.
  - **Footer** — working state shows a live pill `✶ working · Ns · Esc to stop`; the HUD row carries
    `model · ~<used>/<max> tok · <n> turns · <mode>`; the empty prompt shows a right-aligned
    `↵ send · Tab complete` hint. The mode chip keeps its colour (`⚡ yolo` gold, `◆ smart` moonlight).

### Fixed
- **Retained TUI kept no colour** — every non-assistant line (the `❯` user echo, tool anchors, the
  green/salmon edit diff) was run through `strip_ansi_codes` and then repainted one flat grey, so
  you couldn't tell your own message from the model's reply or read an edit's `+`/`−` at a glance.
  The retained backend now keeps SGR colour codes (dropping only cursor moves / erases) and parses
  them into styled ratatui spans at draw time; uncoloured text is unchanged.
- **User chat lines now read as yours** — the whole `❯ …` echo takes the moonlight accent (was just
  the arrow), in both a live turn and a `/sessions` restore replay, so it stands apart from the
  model's grey reply.
- **Empty / failed API turns are surfaced loudly** — a blank turn (rate-limit swallowed into an
  empty 200, content filter, or a gateway that closed the stream early) printed a dim grey aside
  that read like idle. It's now a `⚠ empty reply:` warning naming the likely cause, in both the
  sticky and plain REPLs.
- **Messages typed while the agent works no longer get swallowed** — paste-coalescing keyed off how
  long `read_key` blocked, but a busy output stream makes a hand-typed key arrive pre-buffered, so
  the Enter meant to queue a message became a literal newline and the message sat in the draft
  forever. Detection now measures the gap between successive key *arrivals*, folding the slow
  repaint into the gap so a real keystroke is never mistaken for a paste.
- **Image-attachment chip missing in the retained TUI** — pressing Ctrl-O (clipboard screenshot) or
  dropping an image file attached it correctly (the send carried the image), but the retained input
  box never drew the pending count, so there was no visible confirmation. `draw_footer` now renders
  the `[Nimg]` chip (matching the classic renderer), reserving its width from the typing budget and
  offsetting the caret so it never overlaps the typed text.

### Changed
- **Tool-call anchor glyph** — replaced the florette `✿` with a solid diamond `◆` (moonlight
  silver): a cleaner, more basic mark. The result digest under it still carries state colour
  (green when done, salmon on error).
- **Sun logo reads as a sun at terminal resolution** — the brand's 32 thin-ray chrysanthemum sun
  is faithful in the high-res sixel image, but a low-res braille character grid (the logo on
  launch) shattered those thin lances into scattered `░▒▓` dots that looked like noise.
  `petal_mask` is now resolution-aware: sixel (≥128px) keeps the true 16+16 thin rays; the char
  grid draws a bolder 12-ray sun (thicker lances, larger solid hub).

### Removed
- **Retained idle "3D" spinning-sun animation** — dropped entirely to keep the TUI light: no
  per-frame render thread wakeups when idle, and the now-dead `tui_performance` / `idle_animation`
  config knobs are gone with it. The landing splash logo (static sun) is unchanged.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **Markdown tables no longer dump raw pipes** — the delimiter-row detector required 3+ dashes per
  cell, so the short separators models routinely emit (`|--|`, `|-|`) failed table detection and the
  raw `| … |` rows printed verbatim. Now accepts any GFM-valid delimiter (≥1 hyphen, optional `:`).
- **Code / `diagram` fences render as a true rectangle** — the top and bottom borders were capped
  near 56 columns while body content ran to the full terminal width, so wide content sprawled past a
  narrow frame. All three render paths (streaming, retained, unterminated-fence fallback) now share
  one capped width for the top border, every body row (padded and closed with a right rule), and the
  bottom border, measured by display width rather than byte length.

### Changed
- **Tool-call anchor glyph** — replaced `⏺` (force-rendered as a blue emoji disc by most terminals,
  ignoring the theme color) with the monochrome florette `✿`, which takes the moonlight-silver accent
  and echoes the Aizen chrysanthemum-sun mark.

### Added
- **Retained TUI foundation + runtime safety** — alternate-screen single-owner renderer, structured
  transcript streaming, full-message Markdown cache, retained overlays/panel status, local frame
  metrics, and Mermaid-to-Unicode fallback; classic/plain remain rollback paths.
- **Static/dynamic prompt lanes + crash recovery** — stable project/environment prefix stays cacheable;
  volatile identity/memory refreshes only at fresh user-turn boundaries. Owner-only recovery leases
  restore safe history and prefill interrupted drafts without auto-submitting or replaying tools.
- **MCP lifecycle hardening** — poisoned transport reconnect, one read-only retry only, destructive
  no-replay after ambiguous failure, manager/connection generations, per-turn schema pinning, and
  deferred `tools/list_changed` refresh at the next user turn. MCP trust writes are atomic owner-only.
- **Browser profiles and routing** (`--features browser`) — versioned `~/.aizen/browser.json`, named CDP
  profiles, host routes, environment-reference-only auth attached to HTTP discovery AND the WebSocket
  upgrade, per-conversation session isolation (LRU-capped, released on `/new`/route removal), ref
  invalidation, sanitized `/browser` status, read-only snapshot retry, and no replay of
  navigate/click/type/eval.
- **Terminal-native reply visuals** — configurable `auto|always|off` final-answer contract, responsive
  Markdown tables (boxed wide / stacked narrow), and topology-safe `diagram`/`ascii`/`flow` fences.
  One-shot chat and workflow synthesis share the renderer; Telegram/Discord receive plain stacked
  tables with newline-aware UTF-16 chunking.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Harness persistence P0** — incomplete session todos now auto-poke the top-level loop before an
  early text-only exit; confidence spikes at `Done` trigger one evidence re-check; quantifiable
  optimization goals are reframed into metric → baseline → iterate loops. The deterministic loop
  eval suite covers todo-poke, confidence-gate, and hill-climb behavior.
- **Symbolic edit tools** — `symbol_replace` / `symbol_insert` rewrite or insert relative to a
  named symbol via the language-server outline range (Serena-style; no `old_string` thrash).
- **`/workflows` multi-agent status** — process-global live registry of `task` / `workflow` /
  workflow children (phase, elapsed, detail) + sub-agent slot gate (`active/cap`). Open mid-turn
  to watch fan-outs; aliases `/wf`, `/workflow`. Empty state explains how to launch multi-agent work.
- **`StopReason::Cancelled`** — cooperative cancel mid-loop (Esc); nested `task` / workflow children
  stop at the next boundary instead of running to max_iters.

### Changed
- **LSP default ON (lazy)** — manager arms at session start; language servers still spawn only on
  first symbol query. `/lsp off` reclaims RAM; tools reappear after `/lsp on`.
- System prompt prefers outline/definition + symbolic edit over dumping whole files / grep for
  semantic code questions.
- **Multi-agent hardening** — CLI `aizen workflow` shares singular-writer + `SubagentSlot` +
  orchestration Track with the tool path; workflow children use task-like budgets (15/30 steps);
  synthesis truncates child summaries; sub-agents get LSP nav + coder symbolic edit; ultimate
  prompt prefers real `workflow` fan-out/verify.
- **Sticky `/sessions` repair** — the conversation picker now suspends the sticky footer and parks
  the background keyboard reader before dialoguer owns the terminal. Restore/save/delete and
  confirmation no longer corrupt the footer or merge menu lines.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Config hub menu** — `aizen config` is a sectioned dashboard (edit one field and save) for
  configured installs; first-run still walks the linear wizard.
- **5-tier effort + `/ultimate`** — effort scale includes `xhigh`/`max`; `/ultimate` = max effort +
  orchestrate-by-default (ultracode analogue); optional adaptive difficulty→effort routing.
- **`file_move` tool** — rename/move file or directory (`overwrite` / `create_dirs`, cross-fs
  fallback); arms the post-edit verify gate.
- **Hostbot (Telegram + Discord)** — multi-bot self-host daemon (`aizen serve`, `/addbot`/`/rmbot`,
  pairing-code owner capture, per-sub-bot persona, `bot_admin` tool, systemd `--install`);
  two-way bots moved out of `channels/` into `src/hostbot/`.
- **Agent run-scoped Time Machine recovery** — auto-anchors `pre_edit` (before first edit) and
  `last_good` (after each successful edit), plus tool `checkpoint_rewind`
  (`target=last_good|pre_edit`, max 2 rewinds per run). Verify-gate failures hint at rewind when an
  approach is cascading-broken. Free-form `aizen time restore <id>` remains human-driven.
- **TUI polish** — sticky sessions menu, pure-print slash text overlay, clearer session-delete
  flow, shimmer on the working-verb line; Windows console mode restored on exit.
- **File discovery rewrite** — bounded parallel `file_glob` / smarter `search_files` / tighter
  `repo_map` (node+wall budgets, no junction loops, fuzzy+proximity ranking, UTF-16 detection).

### Changed
- **Time Machine hardened** — fail-closed versioned ledger, atomic writes, OS cross-process lock,
  recovery journals, CAS refs, per-linked-worktree namespaces. Snapshots live in a **private store
  under `~/.aizen/timemachine/<repo-id>/`** (no longer writes into the source repo's `.git`).
  Internal Git disables hooks/fsmonitor/external filters; restore saves a preimage and verifies the
  tree. Added `aizen time doctor [--json] [--repair]` / `aizen time gc`.
- **Unified approval** — `/approval ask|smart|yolo` replaces the overlapping `/smart` + `/yolo`
  toggles (aliases still accepted). `--yes`/`AIZEN_YES` still mean Yolo; hard `cmd_guard` floor is
  non-overridable.
- **Evolutionary persona self-memory** (lean Generative-Agents × MemoryBank × CoALA × A-MEM):
  event-gated episodes (skip small-talk), typed free notes, near-dup + insight-cover dedup,
  formative-only reflection, insight-first `<self>` injection.
- **Repo + session scoped memory (token-lean):** always-on `<user_memory>` = **STYLE + global
  prefs only**; per-repo frozen-core cache (`cli-memory/core/active/<slug>.md`); inferred facts park
  in **session working memory** (L2, cleared on `/new`); durable long-tail stays zone-tagged via
  `memory_search`. Default core budget 800 tok; session inject cap 300 tok.
- Workflow slot accounting: one subagent slot per concurrent child (`acquire_up_to`), not one per
  whole call; live inline progress for the tool path.
- Edit ladder R5.5: blank-line-insensitive matching rung.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-27 — first public release

The first tagged cut of the Aizen CLI: a single pure-Rust static binary (rustls-only TLS, no C/C++
deps in the default build), OpenAI-compatible — point it at any `/chat/completions` endpoint.

### Highlights
- **Unified chat + agent REPL** with a sticky pinned input box, live `% context` HUD, streaming
  Markdown render, multi-line paste coalescing, and image (vision) input.
- **Tool-calling agent loop** — native `tool_calls[]` with divergence self-resolve, one-shot
  auto-extend, a mid-loop context guard, parallel read-only tool batches, and a post-edit verify
  gate (`cargo check` / `tsc`).
- **Self-learning memory brain** (the moat) — BM25 lexical floor with NFC/Vietnamese-aware
  tokenization, reuse-driven evolution, anti-bloat (dedup/supersede/decay/caps), theory-of-mind
  profile + dialectic, and an opt-in fuzzy/dense tier (`NG_MEM_FUZZY` / `NG_MEM_DENSE`).
- **MCP client** (stdio + Streamable-HTTP) with **OAuth 2.1 (PKCE) sign-in apps** (Linear, Notion,
  Slack, Gmail, Atlassian, …) and a curated `aizen apps` catalog over the official registry.
- **Remote control & notifications** — Telegram + Discord two-way bots (`aizen serve` /
  `aizen discord serve`), Discord/Slack/webhook outbound `notify`, and daemon-free `aizen cron`.
- **Skills, personas, SOUL, custom slash commands, time machine** (git snapshots), and a
  katana-style web crawler.

### Safety
- Per-action approval in the TUI (`[y]es · [n]o · [a]llow all this session`), `/yolo` / `/smart`
  tiers, and a hard `cmd_guard` floor (incl. GNU long-flag `rm` root-deletes) that holds even under
  `/yolo`.
- SSRF floor on the web tools (refuses loopback / private / link-local / cloud-metadata targets;
  opt out with `AIZEN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NET=1`).
- `confine()` cwd jail on file/shell tools; long-lived secret files (config, OAuth/MCP token caches,
  sessions) written owner-only (0600) on Unix.

### Notes
- Optional features (off by default): `--features dense` (semantic embeddings; needs a C++
  toolchain + a local model) and `--features browser` (CDP browser tools, stays pure-Rust).
- Home/data root: `~/.aizen` (override with `AIZEN_HOME`; legacy `NEXTGEN_HOME` honored, and a
  pre-rebrand `~/.nextgen` is auto-migrated on first run).
